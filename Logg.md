Decided to make a magic 8 ball. Did a basic wireframe and design in Figma but have some ideas about how to make it different. For instance instead of an 8 ball perhaps a sphere of some kind. Started writing the basic skeleton and wrote the function in javascript to make sure everything works. After getting to this stage I'm starting to get worried that the actual code i need is too simply. Thinking about ways to make it more advanced and what I came up with was to spice up the design and add some cool animations. Animations was something we did before that I felt we did not spend enough time on so would love to dive deeper into it. Just worried the actual code might stil be too simple. Will brainstorm a bit this evening but worried that I if I switch to something else I will only have 3 days to finish it.


What I need
- inputfield for question
- button to get result
- where should the result show up?
    would like them inside the circle
    maybe have a shadowy orb inside the circle

-javascript
    - clear when new question is asked
    - array with answers
    -
