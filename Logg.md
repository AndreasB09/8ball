Decided to make a magic 8 ball. Did a basic wireframe and design in Figma but have some ideas about how to make it different. For instance instead of an 8 ball perhaps a sphere of some kind. Started writing the basic skeleton and wrote the function in javascript to make sure everything works. After getting to this stage I'm starting to get worried that the actual code i need is too simply. Thinking about ways to make it more advanced and what I came up with was to spice up the design and add some cool animations. Animations was something we did before that I felt we did not spend enough time on so would love to dive deeper into it. Just worried the actual code might stil be too simple. Will brainstorm a bit this evening but worried that I if I switch to something else I will only have 3 days to finish it.

Done the basics. The site works and does what I want and most of the styling is done. Looking for more things to add. Went looking for inspiration and researching. Spent a lot of time looking into how I can make the animations I have in mind. Some of them are already in place but I have a few ideas that I would like to implement.

Had an idea to add some color selectors for the page. Was thinking I'd go elemental themed so fire, water, earth and then when you click the buttons the colors change. Went back to figma and finalized the design. Made the icons I need in Figma as well. Started coding it and got pretty far. A bit more to go but should get it done tommorow.

Ran into some problems with the javascript code. Figured it would be as basic as doing a darkmode but that approach didn't quite work. Tried a couple of different things and ended up using switch cases for the elements. After that I spent most of the afternoon trying to get the pulse animation to change color on css depending on what icon you pressed but it wouldn't do it and became quite messy. Realized I might need to do that as in javascript as well.

Did research on how to link the pulse animation to the list elements and make them cooperate. Eventually I abandoned that idea and figured I already had the code for switching the colors. So I abandoned they way I was trying to do it in css and extended the JS function to incorporate the pulse animation as well.

End of the project;
Not really happy with it. It looks boring, the code is messy and I started over a million times. As usual once I get sort of close to finnished I get a bunch of ideas on what I could add in the future. Kindly feel like I'm just stumbling arouhnd when it comes to javascript and it takes me forever to wrack my brain around what I want to write and how to think around the code. Makes for quite a timesink to even write the most basic stuff. But it's not all gloom. Have quite a few things I've taken from this task that I will plan for in the future. Hopefully I can get around to keep working on this one in the future. Maybe redesign it a bit. It needs more colors for sure and I have some other ideas I would like to incorporate as well.
