Decided to make a magic 8 ball. Did a basic wireframe and design in Figma but have some ideas about how to make it different. For instance instead of an 8 ball perhaps a sphere of some kind. Started writing the basic skeleton and wrote the function in javascript to make sure everything works. After getting to this stage I'm starting to get worried that the actual code i need is too simply. Thinking about ways to make it more advanced and what I came up with was to spice up the design and add some cool animations. Animations was something we did before that I felt we did not spend enough time on so would love to dive deeper into it. Just worried the actual code might stil be too simple. Will brainstorm a bit this evening but worried that I if I switch to something else I will only have 3 days to finish it.

Done the basics. The site works and does what I want and most of the styling is done. Looking for more things to add. Went looking for inspiration and researching. Spent a lot of time looking into how I can make the animations I have in mind. Some of them are already in place but I have a few ideas that I would like to implement.

Had an idea to add some color selectors for the page. Was thinking I'd go elemental themed so fire, water, earth and then when you click the buttons the colors change. Went back to figma and finalized the design. Made the icons I need in Figma as well. Started coding it and got pretty far. A bit more to go but should get it done tommorow.
